Title: String Matching Algorithms  and  Analysis of Texts of Patients with Brain Damage.

Annotation: The aim of the thesis is to collect, compare and implement existing string matching algorithms, and then choose the most suitable one for the analysis of texts of patients with brain damage. This project is connected to the research on the Functional Brain Networks done at our Department. The texts that we plan to analyze will be from the bank of texts available to the Functional Brain Networks research group.
